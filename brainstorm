  Logging pages:
    1. Add a book to the system
    2. Day 1, log as page 0
    3. Day 2, log as page X
        (system calculates pages for Day 1 as X-0)
    4. Day 3, log as page Y
        (system calculates pages for Day 2 as Y-X)
  
  
Ideas of commands for CLI
  Adding book:
    add <id> <title> --author <authors> --genre <genres>
    Ex
    add B1 "The Name of the Wind" --author "Patrick Rothfuss" --genre "Fantasy"
    Output: "The Name of the Wind: Added as B1!"
  List books:
    list/books
    Output: 'B1 : "The Name of the Wind"
             B2 : "Throne of Glass"
             etc.'
  Logging book:
    log <id> <page> <date>
    Ex 1
    log B1 327 010220 
    Output: "B1: Logged!"
    Ex 2 (today)
    log B1 123
    Output: "B1: Logged!" 
  Checking stats:
    stats <id> 
    stats <month>
    stats <year>
    stats 
    // no argument -> shows lifetime
    Ex
    stats B1
    Output: Pages read, Average/Day, Genres, Start/Finish date
    stats JAN
    Output: Pages read, Average/Day, (Graph)
    stats 2019
    Output: Pages read, Average/Day, (Graph)
    stats
    Output: Pages read, Average/Day
  Checking library:
    lib/library/shelf
    Output: List of books
              Status: NotStarted/Reading/Finished
              Start/Finish dates
              Authors
              Genres
              Internal ID?? 
    IMPORTANT
      Regarding ID vs Internal ID
      stats <id> would not work if the book was finished/replaced
  Exporting
    export <path>
    Output: "Exported to <path>!"
  Importing
    import <path>
    Output: "Imported from <path>!"
